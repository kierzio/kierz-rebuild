# Your rule content

Kierz.io Portfolio Project Rules
Project Architecture

Maintain the Gatsby single-page application structure with section-based components
Use React functional components with hooks for all new features
Follow the established directory structure: components/UI/, components/Sections/, components/Layout/, etc.
Keep the Hero component as the flagship feature with the interactive particle background

Styling & Design System

Maintain the cyberpunk aesthetic with neon blue (#00f0ff) and purple (#bf00ff) accents on dark backgrounds
Use Tailwind CSS exclusively for styling with utility classes
Follow the established color variables defined in global.css
Preserve the glowing effects and animations that define the cyberpunk theme
Use the Orbitron font for headings and Inter for body text

Component Development

Ensure all components are responsive with mobile-first approach
Implement smooth scrolling between sections
Use proper z-indexing to ensure particle effects don't interfere with UI interactions
Maintain a consistent fade-in animation pattern for section content
Implement fallback options for complex features (as done with CyberBackground for particles)

Performance Considerations

Keep particle count reasonable to maintain performance (max 100 particles)
Implement lazy loading for sections below the fold
Ensure animations run at 60fps or better

State Management

Use localStorage for persistent user preferences (like username)
Implement proper error handling, especially for the particle background
Use React's useEffect for side effects with proper cleanup functions

Build & Deployment

Ensure all code passes Gatsby build process without warnings
Maintain clean git commits with descriptive messages
Test changes in development before pushing to main branch

Future Components

Work section: Implement filterable project cards with consistent styling
About section: Include skills and timeline with animations consistent with cyberpunk theme
Contact form: Include validation and visual feedback matching design system
ChatBot component: Simple AI interaction with cyberpunk styling

Technical Constraints

Support modern browsers only (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
Maintain compatibility with react-tsparticles v2.9.3 for the particle background
Ensure webpack integration works properly with Gatsby's build system

Code Style

Use descriptive variable names that reflect cyberpunk theme when appropriate
Format code with consistent indentation (2 spaces)
Place component state definitions at the top of components
Use async/await for asynchronous operations
Include console logs for debugging during development but remove before production
